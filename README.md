Campaigner
=======================

## Overview

An app to facilitate running petition campaigns with a decoupled  back-end serving HTML5 and native apps.

Petition creation and data storage is handled by a Ruby on Rails back end. Rails serves petitions as JSON to public-facing front-ends, and accepts a JSON stream of signatures. 

## Directory structure

Most of the repository is for running the Rails application.

A web front-end designed for Amnesty International is provided in [/public](/public). Design materials are in [/design](/design).

## How to get started developing

You will need:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [SQLlite](https://sqlite.org/)
* [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

Linux machines are good to go with the above, more-or-less. Congratulations! Nonetheless, [Ryan Bigg](http://ryanbigg.com) has writen [a good tutorial](http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/) for setting yourself up on Linux, just in case.

If you are on a PC or a Mac and this is your first time setting up you development machine for Ruby or Rails, [Rails installer](http://railsinstaller.org/en) can save you time and headache.

If you're on a Mac and you'd rather configure things yourself, you'll need XCode, Command Line Tools, and Homebrew at minimum. [Peter Rhodes](https://github.com/createdbypete) has writen [a how-to](http://createdbypete.com/articles/ruby-on-rails-development-with-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/) for starting your first Rails project on OSX.

If you're on Windows PC, use the Rails installer and enjoy the hours (days!) of pain you have just avoided. Î‘ Windows development environment is not recommended for Rails projects, however.
